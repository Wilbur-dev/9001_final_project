This is a virtual pet program aimed at all people who need pet companionship but do not have the energy to take care of their pets. Here, you can choose your favorite pet such as a cat, dog, or rabbit and give it your favorite name. Once you adopt a pet, you can engage in a series of interactions with it. You can feed your pet, and when the feeding reaches a certain amount, the pet will grow up by one year. You can also interact with it, coax it to sleep and wake it up, and the pet will respond according to your instructions. When you want to end the game, you can follow the instructions to exit. 
Start from main.py and hope you enjoy the game!
